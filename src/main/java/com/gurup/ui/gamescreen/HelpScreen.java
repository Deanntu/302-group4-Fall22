The game space takes place on the KOÃ‡ university campus where a student is trying to find a sequence of keys in the campus buildings. The game starts when the player enters one of the buildings and starts looking for a key in different rooms. During that journey, aliens may show up and try to catch the player, who should try to escape or distract them. The player is aiming at finding the key before the timeout. To accomplish that, some hints show up here and there. Once the key is found, the building will be marked as complete and the player can choose the next open building, which is basically the next level. Some promotions can be offered, like adding more time. The game is over If the player fails to find the key within the time limit. If he manages to find all the keys, then he wins the game.\n" +
