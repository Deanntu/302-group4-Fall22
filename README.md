# COMP302-Project

Escape From Koç is a fun game that takes place on a college campus. The player wanders 
around the faculty buildings level by level and tries to obtain hidden keys to eventually reach the 
last door in a limited time. The player has three lives which can be lost to randomly appearing 
aliens. There are multiple types of aliens which helps make the game more challenging. Escape 
From Koç also has entities like power ups and item bags just like some of the most popular games 
in the game industry. Randomly appearing power ups require the player to act fast in order to pick 
them which makes the game more interesting and eye-catching.

The project design can be found in the finalReport.pdf.
